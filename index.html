        <h1>Database Management System (DBMS)</h1>

        <h2>What is DBMS?</h2>
        <p>
            A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that helps users store, manage, and retrieve data
            efficiently. It acts as an interface between the database and its users or application programs, ensuring
            that data is consistently organized and easily accessible.

        <h2>Types of DBMS</h2>
        <p>
            There are several types of DBMS, including:
            <strong>Hierarchical DBMS</strong>, <strong>Network DBMS</strong>, <strong>Relational DBMS (RDBMS)</strong>,
            and <strong>Object-Oriented DBMS</strong>. Among these, RDBMS is the most widely used, supporting SQL and
            organizing data into tables.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages of DBMS</h2>
        <p>
            DBMS provides numerous benefits such as data security, reduced data redundancy, efficient data access, and
            support for multi-user environments. It also offers features like backup, recovery, and concurrency control.
        </p>

        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
        <p>
            DBMS is used in various real-world applications such as banking systems, airline reservation systems,
            university record management, and e-commerce websites to manage customer and product data efficiently.
